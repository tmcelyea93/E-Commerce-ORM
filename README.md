# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
In this project, the purpose was to build a back end for an E-Commerce website.

## Installatiom
1. Express.js
2. Sequelize
3. Node.js
4. MySQL

## Usage
To use this application, the user must type "node server.js" until the console reads 'App listening on port 3001'. Then they can test the routes in Insomnia. 

## Issues
With this project, I ran into several issues running the information on Insomnia; more specifically with my "Sequelize" package. A video demonstration will be put into this ReadMe once the issue with Sequelize is closed.
